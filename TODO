Slave Interface:
	CLI Arguments:
		If multiple arguments are passed, they will be executed from left to right with side effects, i.e., if a command changes it will propagate to the next ones
		Position Command:
			☐	Set Position Command
				This command will make the robot move to the provided position and return an acknoledge token
				✔	-pset:[xyz-values]		-> ack<ok> (25-04-12 18:02)
				==	-pset:[10,10,10]
				☐	-pset:<vfmt>[vvalues]	-> ack<ok>
				==	-pset:XY[10,10]
				✔	-pset:<coord><value>	-> ack<ok> (25-04-12 18:02)
				==	-pset:X10
			☐	Get Position Command
				This command will return the current position of the robot
				-pget:<vfmt> -> [vvalues]
				==	-pget:X
				==	-pget:XYZ

		Coordinate Mode:
			☐	Set Coordinate Mode
			This command will change how pset commands are interpreted and return an acknowledge token
				Relative will add to the current values
				Absolute will set from the machine 0
				-cset:<coord-mode>	-> ack<ok>
				==	-cset:rel
				==	-cset:abs
			☐	Get Coordinate Mode
			This command will return the current coordinate mode of the robot
				-cget	-> <coord-mode>
				==	-cget

Frame Controller: 
	Maybe using $2USD boards can be more beneficial if any problem is to occur
	Pi Pico Migration:
		✔	Research (25-05-14 18:22)
			✔	Serial communication (25-05-14 18:22)
			✔	Stepper motor interfacing (25-05-14 18:22)
			✔	OLED Screen UI (25-04-20 04:15)
			The OLED works even in another thread
			✔	MicroPython or Arduino SDK (25-04-20 04:16)
			From what I researched, MicroPython is suitable
		☐	Stepper Motor Testing for 3 concurrent steppers
		☐	Zeroing routine test
